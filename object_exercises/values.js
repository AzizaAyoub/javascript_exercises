// Which of the following values are primitive values? Which are objects? Which are neither?


"foo" // primitive value
3.1415 // primitive value
[ 'a', 'b', 'c' ] // (arrays are object)
false // primitive value
function bar() { return "bar"; } // (fuctions are object)
undefined // primitive value
{ a: 1, b: 2 } // object
foo // neither primitive nor object
// foo is an identifier. Identifiers are used to name things that have values, such as variables and functions, but they are not values by themselves. Thus, they are neither primitive values nor objects.
